# duniter-java-nodes-explorer
Explore duniter nodes and visually check for forks and stability of the network.
This is an Eclipse project, but if you checkout, you will also get the bin folder so it is already executable.
You will need java 8 installed.
In the "bin" directory, just type 

    java duniter.java.nodes.explorer.ExploreNodes [rootnode]

The default rootnode is g1.duniter.org:443.
